Subject: Request for Academic Scholarship  

Respected Sir/Madam,

A scholarship would significantly ease the financial burden and help me continue my education with focus and determination. I assure you that I will uphold the values of the institution and continue to perform to the best of my abilities.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
